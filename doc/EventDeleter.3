.SH DESCRIPTION

The EventDeleter interface is used for specifying which event should
be deleted from the event queue.  When \fBdeleteEvents\fR is called on
a Notifier instance, it will invoke the \fBdeleteEvent\fR method of
the EventDeleter argument passed to it, once for each event in the
event queue. \fBdeleteEvent\fR returns 1 for all events that should be
deleted and 0 for events that should remain in the queue.  If
\fBdeleteEvent\fR determines that an event should be removed, it
should perform appropriate clean up on the event instance.
