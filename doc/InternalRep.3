.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBInternalRep\fR class is an abstract base class of all the
internal representation types in Tcl.  All InternalRep subclasses must
implement the following three methods.
.TP
\fBdispose\fR
The \fBdispose\fR method is called when an InternalRep is no longer
used by Tcl. It should free all the resources used by this InternalRep
instance.
.TP
\fBduplicate\fR
The \fBduplicate\fR method is called when an exact copy of the
InternalRep is needed during a copy-on-write operation.
.TP
\fBtoString\fR
The \fBtoString\fR method is called when a string representation is
needed for a TclObject.
