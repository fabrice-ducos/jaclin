.SH DESCRIPTION

The \fBAssocData\fR interface is used by extensions to associate
their own data with a Tcl interpreter.  When the interpreter is
disposed via \fIinterp\fR.\fBdispose\fR, the \fBdisposeAssocData\fR
methods of all the registered AssocData instances are called to
perform the necessary clean up.  Note that if an association is
removed as a result of the \fIinterp\fR.\fBsetAssocData\fR or
\fIinterp\fR.\fBdeleteAssocData\fR calls, the \fBdisposeAssocData\fR
method of the removed AssocData instance is \fINOT\fR called.
