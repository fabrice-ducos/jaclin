.SH INTERFACE
tcl.lang.CommandWithDispose -- interface for defining new
Tcl commands that requires clean-up.

.SH EXTENDS
Command

.SH METHODS
.sp
abstract void \fBdisposeCmd\fR()

.SH DESCRIPTION

This interface is used to define more sophisticated commands that
require clean-up when the command is deleted from an interpreter.
When the command represented by the CommandWithDispose instance is
deleted from an interpreter, either via the \fIinterp\fR.\fBdeleteCommand\fR
method or when the interpreter itself is deleted, the \fBdisposeCmd\fR
method is invoked to free any resources that were allocated when the
command was created.
