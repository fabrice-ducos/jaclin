.SH CLASS
tcl.lang.Extension -- The base class for building dynamically loadable Tcl
extensions.

.SH METHODS
.sp
void \fBinit\fR(Interp \fIinterp\fR)
.sp
void \fBsafeInit\fR(Interp \fIsafeInterp\fR)
.sp
static void \fBloadOnDemand\fR(Interp \fIinterp\fR, String
\fIcmdName\fR, String \fIclsName\fR)

.SH ARGUMENTS
.AS TclObject "table[]" .
.AP Interp interp
The interpreter in which the extension is to be loaded.
.AP Interp safeInterp
The interpreter in which the extension is to be loaded safely.
.AP String cmdName
Name of the Tcl command to be loaded.
.AP String clsName
The full pathname of the Java class to load as a Tcl command. The
class should implement the \fBCommand\fR interface.

.SH DESCRIPTION

The Extension class is used to create dynamic Tcl extension, which can
be loaded into a running Jacl interpreter with the \fBjava::load\fR
Tcl command

.TP
\fBinit\fR
A dynamic Tcl extension should override the \fBinit\fR method to to
perform initialization specific to the given extension. Usually, this
means creating new commands inside the interpreter.
.TP
\fBsafeInit\fR
The \fBsafeInit\fR method is similar to \fBinit\fR, but it's used to
perform initializations when the package is loaded into a safe
interpreter. It should only enable features that are deemed "safe" to
be executed by untrusted Tcl scripts.
.sp
Note: safe interpreters are not currently implemented in Jacl and this
function is currently only for future compatibility.

.TP
\fBloadOnDemand\fR
The \fBloadOnDemand\fR method arranges a \fBCommand\fR implementation
class, specified by \fIclsName\fR, to be loaded into the JVM the first
time the command \fIcmdName\fR is executed; this can reduce the time
it takes to initialize an Extension. The class must implement either
the \fBCommand\fR interface or the \fBCommandWithDispose\fR interface.
