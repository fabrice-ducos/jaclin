1. Introduction
---------------

Jacl (which stands for Java Application Command Language) is a
platform independent scripting language for Java. The feature set and
functionality of Jacl are structured to mirror the scripting language
Tcl version 8. In addition to the write-once-run-anywhere
philosophy, Jacl provides it's user with two other key concepts.
First, Jacl enables users to write Tcl extensions entirely in Java.
Extension writers can use the classes supplied in tcl.lang.*, as well
as any other classes, to write portable extensions.  Second, Jacl
includes the Java Package, which provides a direct Tcl interface to
Java Objects.  For example, the Java Package contains a Tcl command,
java::info, that provides a Jacl user with information about the
public methods, fields, etc. of a given Java class or object.  The
Java Package enables the user to script Java.

2. Documentation
----------------

The best way to get started with Jacl is to look at the demos provided
in this release.  The "docs" directory contains additional
information.  See the "diffs.txt" file in this directory for a list of
Tcl features and the extent to which they are implemented in Jacl.
Also, look at the Scriptics Jacl and Tcl Blend page at
http://www.scriptics.com/java for other useful information.


3. Requirements
---------------

The Jacl distribution requires the Java Development Kit 1.1 or
greater. Jacl has been tested on Win95, WinNT, Solaris, IRIX,
and Linux. It should also work on other systems that
have a correctly implemented Java VM.

Jacl works under JDK1.2, see known_issues.txt for
a list of known problems and bugs.

4. Installation
---------------

If you are compiling on a UNIX system cd to the "unix" subdirectory.
If you are compiling under Windows, then cd to the "win" subdirectory.
Then, for installation instructions, see the README file in that directory.

5. License Agreement
---------------------

See the file "license.terms" for information on usage and 
redistribution of this file, and for a DISCLAIMER OF ALL WARRANTIES.

6. Contact Information
----------------------

Jacl 1.0 was released by the now defunct SunScript group at Sun Labs.
The majority of the Jacl/Tcl Blend developers spun out of Sun Labs
into Scriptics.

Newer version of Jacl were developed primarily by people outside of Scriptics,
with assistance from Scriptics.

7. Getting Help
----------------

Users of Tcl Blend or Jacl should make use of the tcljava-user mailing
list at SourceForge. This is the place to ask questions or post scripts
that are causing you trouble. Basically, any Jacl or Tcl Blend related
question is fine on the user list.

http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tcljava-user

There is also a mailing list for Jacl and Tcl Blend developers.
If you have a specific question about some implementation feature,
have a patch for Jacl or Tcl Blend, or are interested in implementing
some feature, then you should post a note to the developers mailing list.

http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tcljava-dev

Note that you will have to subscribe to the mailing lists before
posting to them. Some people this is is somehow "unfriendly", but
if we did not do this the mailing list would be full of spam and
it would be useful to nobody.

In addition to the mailing lists, you can ask about Jacl or Tcl Blend
or on the Tcl newsgroup. The network news group "comp.lang.tcl"
intended for the exchange of information about Tcl, Tk, and
related applications. It can also be useful to do a google groups
search on comp.lang.tcl for Jacl or Tcl Blend related questions.

When reporting bugs, please provide a short Tcl script that we can use
to reproduce the bug.  Make sure that the script runs with bare-bones
Tcl and doesn't depend on any extensions or other programs,
particularly those that exist only at your site.  Also, please include
these additional pieces of information with the script:
    (a) How do we use the script to make the problem happen (e.g.
	what things do we click on, in what order)?
    (b) What happens when you do these things (presumably this is
        undesirable)?
    (c) What did you expect to happen?
    (d) What platform are you running on (Machine, OS, etc.)?
    (e) What releases of Tcl products are you using?

8. Using Jacl in applets
-------------------------

Currently there are many issues that make it difficult to run Jacl as
an applet inside popular web browsers:

a) For remote applets, both Netscape and IE disallow the
   introspection of class members.  This makes it impossible to use
   any of the following commands: java::new, java::call, java::prop,
   java::field, etc.

b) You can install Jacl as a local Java package on your machine to
   get around the restriction mentioned in (a), but then Netscape
   will not read any of the Jacl library scripts, such as init.tcl,
   because it does not allow your applet to read from local disks.

   (a) and (b) together make it difficult to run Jacl as either a
   remote or a local applet.

c) Netscape 4.0.x does not yet support the JDK 1.1 event model.  This
   makes it impossible to create event handlers for any AWT widgets
   created by the java::new command.

Due to these current difficulties, we have decided not try to
support the use of Jacl inside applets.
