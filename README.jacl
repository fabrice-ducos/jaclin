1. Introduction
---------------

Jacl (which stands for Java Application Command Language) is a
platform independent scripting language for Java. The feature set and
functionality of Jacl are structured to mirror the scripting language
Tcl version 8. In addition to the write-once-run-anywhere
philosophy, Jacl provides it's user with two other key concepts.
First, Jacl enables users to write Tcl extensions entirely in Java.
Extension writers can use the classes supplied in tcl.lang.*, as well
as any other classes, to write portable extensions.  Second, Jacl
includes the Java Package, which provides a direct Tcl interface to
Java Objects.  For example, the Java Package contains a Tcl command,
java::info, that provides a Jacl user with information about the
public methods, fields, etc. of a given Java class or object.  The
Java Package enables the user to script Java.

2. Documentation
----------------

The Tcl/Java project website includes a getting started page that
provides a good intro to interacting with Java from Tcl. The website
can be viewed locally by opening docs/website/index.html in a web
browser, or online at the following URL:

http://tcljava.sourceforge.net

One can also find demos included in this release that provide
examples of how to integrate Tcl and Java. The manual page
at docs/website/manual.html provides a useful API reference.
See the "diffs.txt" file in this directory for a list of
Tcl features and the extent to which they are implemented in Jacl.
The "new_features.txt" file describes features that have been
added in each release.

3. Requirements
---------------

The Jacl distribution requires the Java Development Kit 1.2 or
greater. Jacl has been tested on Win95, WinNT, Solaris, IRIX,
and Linux. It should also work on other systems that
have a correctly implemented Java VM. Jacl has been tested on
newer JDK releases up to and including JDK 1.5. See
known_issues.txt for a list of known problems and bugs.

4. Installation
---------------

A unified build system that works under both Unix and Windows
is used to build Jacl. To build on UNIX, just run the supplied
configure script in a shell. To build on Windows, you will
first need to download the msys_mingw package, it provides
a minimal set of tools needed to build applications under
Windows.

See the following Tcl wiki page for Jacl build instructions:

http://wiki.tcl.tk/9875

The Msys + Mingw download is available here:

http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=10894

See the README.TXT file in the msys_mingw download for info
about running the msys shell. The configure script is
run from the msys shell.

To run the configure script, just type ./configure in the
toplevel directory. This runs a configuration script created
by GNU autoconf, which configures Jacl for your system and
creates a Makefile. The configure script allows you to customize
the Jacl configuration for your site; for details on how you can
do this, type "./configure --help" or refer to the autoconf
documentation (not included here). The most commonly used
arguments to the configure script are as follows:

	--prefix=DIR		By default, the configure script will
                                assume that you want to install into
                                /usr/local. Under Windows, the /usr/local
                                directory is mapped to a Windows path
                                based on where you installed mingw_msys.
				One can specify a specific install
                                directory by passing the directory name
                                as an argument to the prefix option.
                                For example, --prefix=/opt/jacl or
                                or --prefix=D:/jacl under Windows.

	--with-jdk=DIR		By default, the configure script will
                                attempt to find the JDK by searching on
                                the PATH for the javac program. If the
                                javac program can not be found on the
                                PATH or if you do not want to use the
				JDK that it finds, you will need to use
                                this switch to tell configure where
                                it should look for the JDK binaries.

	--with-kaffe=DIR	If this switch is given the configure script
				will attempt to configure for use with the
                                Kaffe JVM. See www.transvirtual.com for more
                                info about Kaffe. This switch should be used
                                with the absolute path to the directory where
                                your Kaffe binaries are installed.

	--with-jikes=PROG	The JDK ships with a java compiler called
				javac. This compiler works but it is very
				slow. Many people would rather use the
				jikes compiler from IBM because it is much
				faster than javac and it produces better code.
				On my system, a compile with javac takes
				1 minute while a compile with jikes
                                takes less than 3 seconds. If this switch is
                                given with no PROG argument then the configure
                                script will search for jikes on the PATH.
                                If a PROG argument is provided it must be the
                                absolute path name of your jikes executable.
                                See www.research.ibm.com/jikes for more info.

Running the configure script will generate a Makefile, assuming that
no errors occurred during the configure process. You should now
type "make", this will create two library files called jacl.jar and
tcljava.jar. The jacl.jar library file stores the class files that
are only used by jacl. The tcljava.jar library file stores the class
files that are shared between jacl and tclblend.

After the make finishes you can quickly test out jacl by typing
"make shell" which will drop you into a running jacl shell where
you can type in commands. You can also run the regression tests
by typing "make test". See tests/README for more information
about the regression test suite

When you are ready to install, type "make install" to install
the jacl.jar and tcljava.jar libraries on your system. Doing the
install will also create a wrapper script called jaclsh which you
can use to run jacl without setting the CLASSPATH. After the wrapper
script has been installed a test program will be run to ensure that
the installed program is working correctly. If you want to run jacl
with special arguments you will need to edit the jaclsh script. Note
that you can not run the jaclsh before installing it. Under Windows,
a jaclsh.bat script will also be installed. This batch file can
be used to start Jacl from the Windows explorer or a cmd shell.

6. Getting Help
----------------

Users of Tcl Blend or Jacl should subscribe and post questions
to the tcljava-user mailing list at SourceForge. This mailing
list provides a forum to ask questions or post scripts that are
causing you trouble. Basically, any Jacl or Tcl Blend related
question is on topic for this mailing list.

http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tcljava-user

There is also a mailing list for Jacl and Tcl Blend developers.
If you have a specific question about some implementation feature,
have a patch for Jacl or Tcl Blend, or are interested in implementing
some feature, then you should post a note to the developers
mailing list.

http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tcljava-dev

Note that you will have to subscribe to the mailing lists before
posting to them. Some people think this subscription requirement
is somehow "unfriendly", but without it the mailing list would
be full of spam. It only takes a moment to subscribe and you
can unsubscribe at any time. Posts from users that are not subscribed
to the mailing list will be automatically rejected.

In addition to the mailing lists, you can ask about Jacl or Tcl Blend
or on the Tcl newsgroup. The network news group "comp.lang.tcl"
intended for the exchange of information about Tcl, Tk, and
related applications. It can also be useful to do a google groups
search on comp.lang.tcl for Jacl or Tcl Blend related questions.

When reporting bugs, please provide a short Tcl script that we can use
to reproduce the bug.  Make sure that the script runs with bare-bones
Tcl and doesn't depend on any extensions or other programs,
particularly those that exist only at your site.  Also, please include
these additional pieces of information with the script:
    (a) How do we use the script to make the problem happen (e.g.
	what things do we click on, in what order)?
    (b) What happens when you do these things (presumably this is
        undesirable)?
    (c) What did you expect to happen?
    (d) What platform are you running on (Machine, OS, etc.)?
    (e) What releases of Tcl products are you using?

7. Using Jacl in applets
-------------------------

Currently there are many issues that make it difficult to run Jacl as
an applet inside popular web browsers:

a) For remote applets, both Netscape and IE disallow the
   introspection of class members.  This makes it impossible to use
   any of the following commands: java::new, java::call, java::prop,
   java::field, etc.

b) You can install Jacl as a local Java package on your machine to
   get around the restriction mentioned in (a), but then Netscape
   will not read any of the Jacl library scripts, such as init.tcl,
   because it does not allow your applet to read from local disks.

   (a) and (b) together make it difficult to run Jacl as either a
   remote or a local applet.

c) Netscape 4.0.x does not yet support the JDK 1.1 event model.  This
   makes it impossible to create event handlers for any AWT widgets
   created by the java::new command.

Due to these current difficulties, we have decided not try to
support the use of Jacl inside applets.

8. Development History
----------------------

Jacl 1.0 was released by the now defunct SunScript group at
Sun Labs. The majority of the Jacl developers spun out of
Sun Labs into Scriptics.

Newer versions of Jacl were developed primarily by people outside
of Scriptics, with some assistance from Scriptics.
