# The following variable holds a list of names that will be used as
# memory locations.  You can modifiy the list to include as many memory
# locations as you desire.  A location  with a name like "foo" will create
# two pins "foo input" and "foo output".  Setting the Trigger pin will
# move all input values to the putput pins.
