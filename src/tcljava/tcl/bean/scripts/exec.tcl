# Create the triggers that fire the corresponding exec event.

studio::port in ls -transfer trigger -location north
studio::port in cat -transfer trigger -location north

# Create the In ports that read the args to the above commands.

studio::port in dirName -transfer basicToString

# The result port sends the result of the exec.  The clear port
# is used to notify a component the text is the coming.  It is
# used, for example, to clear any existing text before the new
# data arrives.

# All In port events are bound to the same script, but each 
# passes a string telling the proc who the caller is.
