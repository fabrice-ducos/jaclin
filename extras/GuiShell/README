GuiShell is a java class that uses the Swing toolkit to provide
a graphical user interface to a Jacl shell. It can be used instead
of the tcl.lang.Shell class that ships with jacl. It is not included
in the regular classes because it requires the Swing toolkit to work.

To compile the GuiShell program you will need to make sure the
swingempty.jar file is included on your CLASSPATH. You can then
compile GuiShell.java with swing 1.0 or swing 1.1. You will need
to include the created .class files on your CLASSPATH. Watch out
becasue the GuiShell classes are in the tcl.lang package so
you need to set up the directory structure correctly. The best way
to do this is to use the -d argument to javac.

(build it, also make sure swingall.jar is in your CLASSPATH!)

setenv CLASSPATH ${CLASSPATH}:swingempty.jar:build
mkdir build
javac -d build GuiShell.java

(run it)

java tcl.lang.GuiShell
