Tcl Blend
RCS: @(#) $Id: README.tclblend,v 1.1.1.1 1998/10/14 21:09:22 cvsadmin Exp $

This is the directory where you configure, compile, test, and install 
UNIX versions Tcl Blend.  This directory also contains source files for 
Tcl Blend that are specific to UNIX.

The rest of this file contains instructions on how to do this.  The 
release should compile and run either "out of the box" or with trivial 
changes on any UNIX-like system that approximates POSIX, BSD, or 
System V.  We know that it runs on workstations from Sun.  To compile 
for a PC running Windows, see the README file in the directory ../win.


How To Install Tcl Blend (Binary Release Only):
----------------------------------------------

(a) You must have Tcl version 8.0 installed and compilied as a shared
    library.  See the corresponding unix/README where you have Tcl8.0
    installed for information on how to do this.  
	
    NOTE: Tcl Blend does not work with the alpha release of Tcl8.1.

    NOTE: Tcl Blend is not entirely compatable with the beta release
    of the Java Development Kit 1.2.  If you want to use JDK1.2
    with Tcl Blend, you will have to compile the sources by hand,
    the Tcl Blend binary release will only work with JDK1.1.x

(b) The environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH must contain a path that 
    points to the install directory for Tcl Blend.  You may want to
    edit your .cshrc and add something like:
        setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/opt/java/tclBlend1.1

(c) The environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH must also contain a path that 
    points to the java libraries.  You may want to
    edit your .cshrc and add something like:
        setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH \
          ${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/opt/jdk1.1.6/lib/sparc/native_threads


(d) Tcl Blend is a dynamically loaded module.  To add the Tcl Blend
    functions to the interperter, run tclsh from the install
    directory, and type:
	lappend auto_path [pwd]
	package require java
    At this point, Tcl Blend is ready to be used.  To see if Tcl Blend
    is working, try the commands below 
	set java::jdkVersion
	set c [java::new java.util.GregorianCalendar]
	$c toString


How To Compile And Install Tcl Blend (Source Release Only):
----------------------------------------------------------

(a) You must have Tcl version 8.0 installed and compilied as a shared
    library.  See the corresponding unix/README where you have Tcl8.0
    installed for information on how to do this.

    NOTE: Tcl Blend does not work with the alpha release of Tcl8.1.

    NOTE: Tcl Blend is not entirely compatable with the beta release
    of the Java Development Kit 1.2.

(b) Check for patches as described in ../README.

(c) If you have already compiled Tcl Blend once in this directory and
    are now preparing to compile again in the same directory but for a
    different platform, or if you have applied patches, type "make
    distclean" to discard all the configuration information computed
    previously. 

(d) If the make fails then you'll have to personalize the Makefile
    for your site or possibly modify the distribution in other ways.
    If you need to modify Makefile, there are comments at the beginning 
    of it that describe the things you might want to change and how to 
    change them.

(e) Type "./configure --enable-shared".  This runs a configuration
    script created by GNU autoconf, which configures Tcl Blend for
    your system and creates a Makefile.  The configure script allows
    you to customize the Tcl configuration for your site; for details on
    how you can do this, type "./configure -help" or refer to the
    autoconf documentation (not included here).  Tcl Blend's
    "configure" supports the following special switches in addition to
    the standard ones: 
	--with-tcl		Tcl8.0 is assumed to be installed in 
				../../tcl8.0.  If this is not true, then 
				use this switch to specify an absolute
				path to the location of the Tcl base,
				and set the TCL_LIBRARY environment
				variable to the library subdirectory
				of the Tcl base.
	--with-java		The configure script will attempt to locate
				where the Java JDK is installed.  If it 
				cannot locate the JDK, or an alternative 
				JDK needs to be specified, use this switch,
				followed by an absolute path to the correct 
				directory.
	--enable-gcc		If this switch is set, Tcl will configure
				itself to use gcc if it is available on your
				system.  Note:  it is not safe to modify the
				Makefile to use gcc after configure is run;
				if you do this, then information related to
				dynamic linking will be incorrect.
	--enable-shared		If this switch is specified, Tcl will compile
				itself as a shared library if it can figure
				out how to do that on this platform.

    Note that the value of the --prefix directory is used to by the
    'make install' rule so that Tcl Blend will automatically be loaded
    by 'package require java'

    You can determine the proper value for --prefix by starting up tclsh
    and typing 'set tcl_library', for example:
	user 1% tclsh
	% set tcl_library
	/usr/local/tcltk/tcl/lib/tcl8.0
	% 	
    In this case --prefix should be set to /users/local/tcltk/tcl

(f) Type "make".  This will create a library archive called
    "libtclblend.so", as well as two jar files tclblend.jar and tcljava.jar
    that contains all of the Java class files.

(g) The environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH must contain a path that 
    points to the install directory for Tcl Blend and the JDK
    libraries.  Refer to instructions (b) and (c) for the binary
    release above.

(i) Tcl Blend is a dynamically loaded module.  Refer to step (d) 
    of the binary release above.

Installing Tcl Blend into the Tcl Lib Directory:
-----------------------------------------------

Tcl will automatically locate Tcl Blend if it is properly installed
into the Tcl8.0 lib directory.  This will eliminate the need to append
the Tcl Blend directory to the auto_path before loading the package.

If you have set --prefix properly (see above), then
	make install
should install the necessary files automatically for you.

Tcl Blend also includes a jwish script that will automatically start
up a wish and properly load Tcl Blend.  If you cannot install Tcl
Blend directly in the Tcl library, you can use jwish instead.

jtclsh will start up a tclsh and load Tcl Blend for you.  jtclsh 
is merely a link to jwish.


Test suite (Source Release Only)
--------------------------------

There is a relatively complete test suite for all of the Tcl core in the 
subdirectory "tests".  To use it just type "make test" in this directory.  You
should then see a printout of the test files processed.  If any errors occur, 
you'll see a much more substantial printout for each error.  See the README 
file in the "tests" directory for more information on the test suite.  Note: 
don't run the tests as superuser: this will cause several of them to 
fail.
