This message is to announce the new 1.3.2 release of Jacl and
Tcl Blend.  These releases are the result of efforts by Mo DeJong
and the Jacl and Tcl Blend user community.

The 1.3.2 release of Jacl and Tcl Blend are available for
downloading at the following URL:

    http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=13005

The 1.3.2 version is a "production" ready release, it is
considered stable enough to be used on an everyday basis.
The code in this release is already being used by customers
in production environments on a daily basis.

What's New in the 1.3.2 Release?
----------------------------------

The 1.3.2 release includes a couple of minor new features
and some important bug fixes. Tcl Blend now includes the
file win/libjvm.dll.a, it is needed to build with some broken
JDKs in a Windows environment. Running Jacl and Tcl Blend in
a Windows environment is now easier as a batch file startup
script is now installed as part of the default build.
A pre-compiled Jacl release that includes only the files
needed to run Jacl is now available. The jaclsh startup script
now returns a non-zero exit status if some error was encountered
while processing a script. IO support in the Interp class
has been re-implemented so that it makes use of the new IO
layer. Jacl and Tcl Blend can now be compiled in a JDK 1.5
environment. A number of tricky expr command number parsing
bugs have been fixed in Jacl. Also, the classloader issues that
made it difficult to run Jacl in certain environments have
been resolved.

See the new_features.txt and changes.txt files for more info.

What is Jacl?
----------------

Jacl is a 100% Java implementation of Tcl 8.  This allows Tcl to run
in more environments and also brings the power of scripting to Java
developers.  Jacl implements almost all the features available in
the C version of Tcl and is well tested.

What is Tcl Blend?
------------------------

Tcl Blend is a Tcl Extension that allows you to have access to the
Java VM from the Tcl interpreter.  The goal here is to allow Tcl
developers to write new Tcl extensions in Java rather then C or C++
for better portability.  A developer can also load both Tcl and
Tcl Blend into an existing Java JVM. Tcl Blend is known to work on
Solaris, Windows 95/NT/XP, IRIX, and Linux. Other systems have not
been tested but it should be easy to port Tcl Blend to any system
that supports dynamic loading and the Java JNI interface.
