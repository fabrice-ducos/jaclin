This message is to announce the new 1.2.5 release of Jacl and
Tcl Blend.  These releases are the result of a joint effort by
Mo DeJong, Christopher Hylands, Bryan Surles, and Scott Redman. 
The goal of this project is to extend and improve the 1.0 release 
of Jacl and Tcl Blend which was originally started by the Sun Tcl team.

The 1.2.5 release of Jacl and Tcl Blend are available for
downloading at the following URL:

    http://www.scriptics.com/java

The 1.2 version is a "production" release, it is considered
stable enough to be used on an everyday basis.This is the
first stable release of the 1.2 tree after a year in
development.

What's New in the 1.2.5 Release?
----------------------------------

The new release includes no new features, but it does fix
a couple of bugs present in the 1.2.4 release. The new
release also includes an experimental new build system that
is TEA compliant and should work on both Unix and Windows
systems. The existing build system which uses configure
under windows and VC++ makefiles under Windows is still
supported.

See the new_features.txt and changes.txt files for more info.

What is Jacl?
----------------

Jacl is a 100% Java implementation of Tcl 8.  This allows Tcl to run
in more environments and also brings the power of scripting to Java
developers.  Jacl only implements a subset of the Tcl language (the C
version of Tcl has a lot of features!).  However, the core of the
language is implemented and well tested.

What is Tcl Blend?
------------------------

Tcl Blend is a Tcl Extension that allows you to have access to the
Java VM from the Tcl interpreter.  The goal here is to allow Tcl
developers to write new Tcl extensions in Java rather then C or C++
for better portability.  Tcl Blend is known to work on Solaris,
Windows 95/NT, IRIX, and Linux. Other systems have not been tested
but it should be easy to port Tcl Blend to any system that supports
dynamic loading and the Java JNI interface.

Scriptics support for Jacl and Tcl Blend:
-------------------------------------------------

It is important to understand that this release is due entirely to the
efforts of Christopher Hylands and Mo DeJong. Scriptics currently has
a minor, facilitating role in Jacl and Tcl Blend. Scriptics does provide
enterprise support for Tcl Blend through negotiable support agreements.

If you have a problem with Jacl or Tcl Blend or you think you have
a great idea for a feature, you should send an email to the tcljava
mailing list. Please do not send email directly to the authors.
