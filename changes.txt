env(TCL_CLASSPATH) variable for additional paths to search when loading
classes.  Updated the java.n man page.  (BS)

11/11/97 (new feature) New Notifier API implemented for Jacl. See the
classes Notifier, IdleHandler, TimerHandler. (IL)

12/2/97 (bug fix) Tcl Blend crashed if Java object handles were used from
within namespaces. (SS)

12/2/97 (bug fix) Tcl Blend allowed Java object handles to cross
between interpreters under some circumstances. (SS)

12/2/97 (new feature) New commands for handling JavaBean events:
java::bind, java::event, java::throw and "java::info events". (IL)

12/3/97 (new feature) Added basic support for Java Studio. (RJ)

12/3/97 (new feature) Changed Makefile.in to build the Tcl Bean when 
making a binary release.  Added targets for building the bean.
Updated the release names to b1.  Changed the name of the binary
release for blend that denotes a Solaris release. (BS)

12/3/97 (new feature) Added the Parser class, which is a direct port of
the 8.1 parser. (BS)

12/3/97 (new feature) java::new can initialize Java array objects.
Added new ArrayObject command to manipulate Java array objects. (MH)

12/15/97 (bug fix) Fixed a bug in Util.trimLeft().  If string " " was
passed, the resulting string would still be " ". (BS)

12/15/97 (new feature) added regexp package to binary release.  regex,
regesub, switch -regexp, and lsearch -regesp now work in Jacl's binary
release. (MH)

forward slashes now. (MH)

----------------- Released 1.0b1, 12/19/97 -----------------------

1/5/98 (bug fix) On Windows, cd called with no argument changes to the
env(HOME) directory. (MH)

1/6/98 (bug fix) gets command checks for eof. (MH)

1/13/98 (new feature) Added the java::isnull command as an easier way
to test for null Java objects. (RJ)

1/27/98 (bug fix) glob command now works on both unix and windows. (MH)

1/27/98 (new feature) Added the PackageCmd, thanks to efforts by Moses
DeJong to port command to Java. (BS)

1/27/98 (bug fix) The TclToken class was caching the entire script in
the getTokenString method.  I removed the cache alltogether, because
it was only being called once per TclToken anyway. (BS)

1/28/98 (new feature) Added new functionality to the Tcl Bean.  Ports
can be created from Tcl.  The Studio Customizer can also be scripted
from the Tcl Bean. (BS)

1/28/98 (bug fix) Updated the Makefile.in to build the Tcl Bean and
include it in the binary and source distributions. (BS)

2/2/98 (bug fix) The Parser.logCommandInfo method was making an out of
bounds array access. (BS)

2/2/98 (new feature) Added the java::lock and java::unlock commands to
preserve a Java Object even if the variable's internal rep is
intermediately altered. (BS)

2/3/98 (bug fix) The java::defineclass interface was changed.  If the
className argument did not match the class name contained in the
bytestream, the class was not loaded.  We removed the necessity to
pass the className arg, removed anonymous classes (since they were not
anon.) and are automatically inferring the name from the Class
object. (BS)

2/3/98 (bug fix) The java::load command now loads classes from jar
files, if the jar file are on the -classpath or env(TCL_CLASSPATH)
explicitly. (BS)

2/3/98 (bug fix) The java::load command kept classes loaded even if
all of the classes couldnt be resolved.  The correct behavior is to
remove the class from the TclClassLoader's cache. (BS)

2/7/98 (bug fix) Tcl Blend crashed intermittently on multiprocessor
machines because the finalizer methods on Interp and CObject were
running in a different thread than the rest of the Tcl library. (SS)

2/9/98 (bug fix) Changed the public variable compCode to package
protected, and added the public method getCompletionCode() to retrieve
the current compCode. (BS)

2/9/98 (new feature) The javaAPI.txt file was replaced with
independent *.3 man pages.  All of the man pages have been converted
to HTML, a are available in the doc/html subdirectory. (BS)

2/10/98 (feature change) The milliseconds parameter in the
TimerHandler constructor has been changed from "long" to "int", so
that the API is compatible with Tcl 8.x.
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY *** (IL)

2/11/97 (bug fix) Added "BUILD_DIR=$(BUILD_DIR)" to the target for to
the tclblendtest.exec rule so --src-dir works when running tests. (BS)

2/18/98 (bug fix) Made the Shell class public. (BS)

----------------- Released 1.0, 10/22/97 -----------------------
Changes between TclBlend 1.0 and 1.0up1

8/26/98 (bug fix)  Tcl8.1: Fixes for generic/javaInterp.c: In function
`Java_tcl_lang_Interp_eval': generic/javaInterp.c:277: too few arguments to
function `Tcl_EvalObj' TclBlend apparently has problems with the threading
changes in Tcl8.1.  Apparently Tcl Blend has problems under Tcl8.1, but without
this change it won't even compile. 
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY *** (CXH)

8/26/98 (Unix Makefile change) Uncommented install rule. Now we create
a hard link from jtclsh to jwish.  Added rules to build green.purify,
which is a Purified version of green. See
http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cxh/java/purify/index.html#PurifyJNITcl
for details.  (CXH)

8/26/98 (new feature) Added jwish and init.tcl 
The init.tcl Tcl script sets the CLASSPATH properly.  init.tcl.in gets
processed by configure, which creates init.tcl.  "make install" installs
init.tcl.  jwish is a Bourne shell script which will start up a wish with
tclBlend loaded in.  The key thing is that jwish sets the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
SHLIB_PATH.  jwish.in gets processed by configure, which creates jwish.  make
install installs jwish  (CXH)

8/26/98 (Unix Makefile change)  Added install-sh, copied from Tcl8.0 tree.

8/26/98 (UNIX Makefile change)  Added rules to run Tcl Blend tests under Java
Scope to generate test coverage info.  Currently, about 80% of the methods in
common/tcl/lang are called by the test suite.  For a complete summary, see:
http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cxh/java/tclblend/js/coverage.html
tclblendtest.exec rule: prepend the BUILD_DIR to auto_path so that we don't get
an installed libtclblend.so instead of the one in BUILD_DIR. (CXH)

8/26/98 (UNIX configure change) Fix a problem with missing backquotes in the
lines that used uname.  Many thanks to Christian Krone for pointing this out.  (CXH)

8/26/98 (test change)  JDK1.2 returns slightly different values for FuncSig-1.2
and FunSig-1.3  (CXH)

8/26/98 (new feature) JavaGetEnv(): #ifdefd for use with JDK1.2
JavaGetEnv(): Added tclblend_init Tcl #variable which can be used to under
JDK1.2 to set flags in the JVM while it is #being initialized.  (CXH)

8/26/98 (new feature)  Provide more information when doing a package require
on the java package. If you set "tclblend_init" to "help" before doing the
package require, you will get more feedback.  Note that tclblend_init does not
do anything under JDK1.x  (CXH)

8/26/98 (new feature) appendClasspathMessage(): new function that adds info
about the CLASSPATH to the Tcl result.* (CXH)

8/26/98 (bug fix) Java_tcl_lang_IdleHandler_cancelIdleCall(): #ifdef for JDK1_2
#to fix Java segfault in tests/native/javaIdle.c (CXH)

8/26/98 (Window Makefile change) Use $(jar) instead of jar.  Don't call jar
with the v flag, it causes too much clutter.  (CXH)

8/26/98 (Window Makefile change) Added support for JDK1.2: JDKVERSION variable
is set to 1.1 or 1.2 JAVALIB is changed according to the JDKVERSION Added
install rule clean rule removed .class .pdb and .pch files Use / for cl and
link flags instead of -  (CXH)

8/26/98 (Window Makefile change)  Moved pyramid demos to JAVA_DEMO_CLASSES as
the demo/pyramid directory is not shipped with Tcl Blend (CXH)

8/26/98 (pkgIndex change)  Added ::java::jdkVersion variable that is set to the
version of the runntime JDK.  Added ::java::patchLevel variable, currently set
to 1.0up2  (CXH)

8/26/98 (pkgIndex change)  Expand the pathname in case it is something like
c:/Progra~1/Tcl/lib/tclblend1.0 Without this expansion we have problems loading
tclblend.dll  (CXH))

8/26/98 (new feature) New tcl command for Tcl Blend and Jacl:  java::cast.
The command casts the type of object "s" to the class Object.  It does not
change the type of the ref of "s" it simply makes a new reflected object with
the Object type and the instance "s".  This command is just a tcl binding to
the standard casting functionality in the Java language. (MD)

8/26/98 (new feature) All objects are typed and arrays keep track of the types
in the array.  If old code did something that violates the JavaLangSpec then
it could break the users code.
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY *** (MD)

8/26/98 (new feature) Added tcl command "file nativename" to Jacl. (MD)

8/26/98 (new feature) The java object representation has been changed (in
ReflectObject.java) so that it holds the type of the object as well as the
Object ref.
*** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY *** (MD)

8/26/98 (new feature) The Parser classes (Parser ParseAdaptor TclParse ...)
were changed to remove allocation of CharPointer objects as well as TclToken
objects.  The parser is now much faster and less memory hungry. (MD)

9/21/98 (renamed file) changes is now changes.txt (CXH)

9/21/98 (jdk1.2beta4 port) java.h now defines TCLBLEND_EXTERN.  See tcl.h
for more information.  We now use TCLBLEND_EXTERN everywhere. (CXH)

9/21/98 (bug fix) src/native/javaCmd.c now has trailing NULLs in
Tcl_AppendResults calls (CXH)

9/21/98 (bug fix) src/native/javaCmd.c JavaSetupJava() now prints more
information if a class cannot be found (CXH)

9/21/98 (comment) src/native/javaNotifier.c: Added comment about 
what causes crashes near the comment. (CXH)

9/21/98 (version number) BlendExtension.java, pkgIndex.tcl: Changed 
version number from 1.1.1 to 1.1 and set java::PatchLevel to 1.1a1. (CXH)

9/21/98 (error message) TclClassLoader.java: If we attempt to load
a package that starts with tcl or java, we throw a security exception.
Now we include a detail message that describes why.

9/21/98 (error message) JavaLoadCmd.java: if we get a security exception,
print the detail message. (CXH)

9/21/98 (file reorganization) moved win/pkgIndex.tcl to
src/pkgIndex.tcl.  Removed unix/pkgIndex.tcl. Modified makefiles. (CXH)

9/21/98 (file reorganization) makefile.vc no longer uses version numbers
in directory above javalock.tcl (CXH) 

9/23/98 (bug fix) pkgIndex.tcl needs to find both tclblend.jar
and tcljava.jar (CXH)

9/23/98 (bug fix) Removed Control-Ms from java.h (CXH)

9/23/98 (enhancement) If the java package cannot be found, the
test/defs file prints $errorInfo (CXH)

9/23/98 (bug fix) unix/Makefile now supports configure --srcdir.
Fixed code coverage rules, removed Control-Ms (CXH)

9/23/98 (bug fix) unix/jwish.tcl no longer sources init.tcl,
instead it just does package require java.  Removed init.tcl.in (CXH)

9/29/98 (file reorganization) Created 
src/tests/{invoke,exec,javainfo,signature,tcl} directories and moved 
tests into them so that they are in directories that match
their package names.  Modified makefiles. (CXH)

9/29/98 (feature modification) Formerly, pkgindex.tcl would
throw an error if it found two tclblend.jar or tcljava.jar files.
Now it prints a warning message that includes the names of the two
files. (CXH)

9/30/98 (test suite) JavaLoadCmd.test: Updated tests that load tcl.xxx
classes which expect a SecurityException.  The message had changed on
9/21. (CXH)

9/30/98 (bug fix) Under Tcl Blend, some of the Signature tests
were failing.  The fix was to comment out a section of code
that is caching internal reps in src/tcljava/tcl/lang/FuncSig.java (MD)

9/30/98 (porting) unix/configure.in now sets JAVA_CLASSPATH properly
for JDK1.2beta4 (CXH)

10/4/98 (test suite) tests/javaload should not be in the CLASSPATH.
If it is, we never test the Tcl Java loader because the primordial
Java loader find the test files.  All the test .class files end up
under the tests directory. (CXH)

10/4/98 (dist rules) Updated rules that make distributions, added a
rule that builds a combined Jacl and Tcl Blend distribution called 
tcljava1.1a1.  tcljava1.1a1 is probably of little use to most users,
it is primarily for people interested in rereleasing Jacl and Tcl
Blend. (CXH)

10/8/98 (jacl tests) Don't ship the exec tests with Tcl Blend.
TimerHandlerTest.java,VarTraceTest.java,IdleHandlerTest.java,
TestObjectCmd.java should only be shipped with Tcl Blend.
TestgetplatformCmd.java and NonPublic.java are junk and should not
be shipped.

10/8/98 (jacl regular expressions) Pulled class files out of ORO inc
regular expression code so we can ship them. (MD) 

10/9/98 (configure) Properly handle configuring both Jacl and Tcl Blend
at the same time. (MD)

11/5/98 (man pages) Removed Unix style man pages, the html versions
are more up to date. (MD)

----------------- Released 1.1a1, 11/13/98 -----------------------

11/15/98 (jacl in applet) jacl/tcl/lang/Interp.java, evalResource()):
Catch SecurityException if getResourceAsStream() throws it.  This is
likely to happen if we run Jacl from within an applet. (CXH)

11/15/98 (configure) If the JDK_ARCH_LIB directory ends in
'green_threads', then configure checks to see if there is an adjacent
native_threads directory, prints a message if there is, and then exits
with an error.
We need not set TCL_SRC_DIR by running make topDirName, TCL_SRC_DIR
is set in tclConfig.sh.  Running 'make topDirName' can sometimes
generate text like 'make[4] . . .' so it should be avoided.  (CXH)

11/15/98 (windows pkgindex change)
Under Windows, if tclblend.dll can be found with an absolute path,
then set pre_lib and use it.  JDK1.2 is more picky than JDK1.1 about
finding .dlls. (CXH)

11/16/98 (jwish)
Under HPUX, call uname -s, not arch -s

11/24/98 (misc. minor problems)
* win/README and unix/README were accidentally no shipped with 1.1a1 (CXH)
* doc/html/contents.htm: typo (MD)
* doc/html/TclJava/java.htm: Beefed up info about tclblend_init (CXH)

11/24/98 (unix Makefile.in, configure.in minor cleanups + Digital Unix)
Minor cleanups for how we generate dist files.
Added rules to copy README.* files into place.
Renamed various zip and tar files so that the naming is more uniform.

Changes for Digital Unix:  JDK1.1.4 under Digital Unix V4.0B is installed
in /usr/bin, and we need to look in /usr/include/java and
/usr/include/java/alpha. Substitute in $JAVA_INC_DIR instead of hardwiring
in $(JAVA_DIR)/include. (CXH)

1/7/98 (unix configure)
Search for tcl8.0.4 instead of tcl8.0.3 (CXH) 

1/7/98 (windows line separator)
src/jacl/tcl/lang/Interp.java:
Fix for properly handling \r \n under Windows.  This also fixes problems
with multi-line commands.  Added new method translateLineSeparators(), which
is called when we read in a file and when we eval a resource.
Based on code from Christian Krone <krischan@sql.de>.  Also added
test to test/jacl/Interp.java (CXH)
