This is the directory where you configure, compile, test, and install 
Windows versions of Jacl.

The rest of this file contains instructions on how to do this.  The 
release should compile and run either "out of the box" or with trivial 
changes on a Win95, Win98, or WinNT system. To compile for a UNIX
system, see the README file in the directory ../unix.

How To Compile And Install Jacl
------------------------------------------------------

(1) Run "copy makefile.vc makefile" to create a makefile that
    you will customize for your site.

(2) Open makefile in a text editor and set the variables
    at the top of the file to the locations of your Jacl distro,
    your Java install, and your MS dev tools.

(3) Type "nmake". This will build two library files called
    jacl.jar and tcljava.jar. The jacl.jar library
    file stores the class files that are only used by jacl.
    The tcljava.jar library file stores the class files
    that are shared between jacl and tclblend.

(4) If the make fails then you most likely made a mistake
    setting the paths for your tools. You will need to
    double check the paths you set at the top of the
    makefile and try again.(4) If the make fails then you most likely made a mistake

(5) After the make finishes you can quickly test out Jacl by typing
    "nmake shell" which will drop you into a running Jacl shell
    where you can type in commands. You can also run the
    regression tests for Jacl by typing "nmake test".

(6) When you are ready to install jacl type "nmake install"
    to install the jacl.jar and tcljava.jar libraries on your system.
    The location where the files are installed depends on how you
    set up the variables at the top of makefile.

Test suite:
-----------

There is a relatively complete test suite for all of the Tcl core in the 
subdirectory "tests".  To use it just type "nmake test"
in this directory. You should then see a printout of the test files
processed.  If any errors occur, you'll see a much more substantial
printout for each error.  See the README file in the "tests" directory
for more information on the test suite.
