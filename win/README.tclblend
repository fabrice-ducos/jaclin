Tcl Blend

This is the directory where you configure, compile, test, and install 
Windows versions Tcl Blend. This directory also contains source files for 
Tcl Blend that are specific to Windows.

The rest of this file contains instructions on how to do this.  The 
release should compile and run either "out of the box" or with trivial 
changes on a Win95, Win98, or WinNT system. To compile for a UNIX
system, see the README file in the directory ../unix.

How To Compile And Install Tcl Blend:
----------------------------------------------------------

(1) You must have Tcl version 8.X compilied before you can compile
    Tcl Blend. See the corresponding win/README in the Tcl8.X
    directory for information on how to do this.

(2) Run "copy makefile.vc makefile" to create a makefile that
    you will customize for your site.

(3) Open makefile in a text editor and set the variables at the
    top of the file to the locations of your Tcl and Tcl Blend
    distros, your Java install, and your MS dev tools.

(4) Type "nmake". This will build two library files called
    tclblend.jar and tcljava.jar. The tclblend.jar library file
    stores the class files that are only used by Tcl Blend.
    The tcljava.jar library file stores the class files
    that are shared between jacl and tclblend. Running nmake
    will also create a shared library called "tclblend.dll".

(5) If the make fails then you most likely made a mistake
    setting the paths for your tools. You will need to
    double check the paths you set at the top of the
    makefile and try again.

(6) After the make finishes you can quickly test out Tcl Blend by typing
    "nmake shell" which will drop you into a running Tcl Blend shell
    where you can type in commands. You can also run the regression
    tests for Tcl Blend by running "nmake test".

(7) When you are ready to install type "nmake install"
    to install the Tcl Blend libraries on your system. The location
    where the files are installed depeds on how you set up the
    variables at the top of makefile.

Test suite:
-----------

There is a relatively complete test suite for all of the Tcl Blend core
in the subdirectory "tests".  To use it just type "nmake test"
in this directory. You should then see a printout of the test files
processed.  If any errors occur, you'll see a much more substantial
printout for each error.  See the README file in the "tests" directory
for more information on the test suite.
