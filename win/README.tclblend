Tcl Blend

This is the directory where you configure, compile, test, and install 
Windows versions Tcl Blend. This directory also contains source files for 
Tcl Blend that are specific to Windows.

The rest of this file contains instructions on how to do this.  The 
release should compile and run either "out of the box" or with trivial 
changes on a Win95, Win98, or WinNT system. To compile for a UNIX
system, see the README file in the directory ../unix.

How To Compile And Install Tcl Blend:
----------------------------------------------------------

(1) You must have Tcl version 8.0 compilied before you can compile
    Tcl Blend. See the corresponding win/README in the Tcl8.0
    directory for information on how to do this.

    NOTE: Tcl Blend does not work with Tcl 8.1 yet.

(2) Check for patches as described in ../README.

(3) Open makefile.vc in a text editor and set the variables at the
    top of the file to the locations of your Tcl Blend distro,
    your Java install, and your MS dev tools.

(4) Type "nmake -f makefile.vc". This will build two library files
    called tclblend.jar and tcljava.jar. The tclblend.jar library file
    stores the class files that are only used by Tcl Blend.
    The tcljava.jar library file stores the class files
    that are shared between jacl and tclblend. Running make
    will also create a shared library called "tclblend.dll".

(5) If the make fails then you'll have to personalize makefile.vc
    for your site or possibly modify the distribution in other ways.
    If you need to modify makefile.vc, there are comments at the
    beginning of it that describe the things you might want to
    change and how to change them.

(6) After the make finishes you can quickly test out Tcl Blend by typing
    "nmake -f makefile.vc shell" which will drop you into a running
    Tcl Blend shell where you can type in commands. You can also run
    the regression tests for Tcl Blend by typing "nmake -f makefile.vc test".

(7) When you are ready to install type "nmake -f makefile.vc install"
    to install the Tcl Blend libraries on your system. The location
    where the files are installed depeds on how you set up the
    variables at the top of makefile.vc.

Test suite:
-----------

There is a relatively complete test suite for all of the Tcl core in the 
subdirectory "tests".  To use it just type "nmake -f makefile.vc test"
in this directory. You should then see a printout of the test files
processed.  If any errors occur, you'll see a much more substantial
printout for each error.  See the README file in the "tests" directory
for more information on the test suite.
