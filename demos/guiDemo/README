Abstract
--------

      This demo shows how to use the java::* commands to create GUI
      components and handle user events.

Why Bother?
-----------

      The java::* commands can be used to do rapid development of AWT-
      based GUI applications.  Forget all the fuss of implementing
      event interfaces, using inner classes, etc., to handle
      events.  Just use the java::bind command!

Running the Demo
----------------

      Start either the Jacl Shell or the tclsh with the Tcl Blend library 
      loaded.

      cd to the directory containing this README file.

      Type "source guiDemo.tcl" at the prompt.
      
      Now you can select the employees to fire by selecting their
      names and clicking on the arrow buttons.
