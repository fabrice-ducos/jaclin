Tcl Blend

RCS: @(#) $Id: README.tclblend,v 1.9 2002/12/25 06:17:11 mdejong Exp $

1. Introduction
---------------

Tcl Blend provides two new capabilities to the Tcl system.  First, 
Tcl Blend provides Java classes that expose key pieces of the 
interfaces that are available to extension writers who currently
use C. Using these classes, extension writers can create new 
commands for the Tcl interpreter. In addition, Tcl Blend provides 
commands that allow script writers to directly manipulate Java 
objects without having to write any Java code. The reflection 
classes in Java make it possible to invoke methods and access 
fields on arbitrary objects. Tcl Blend takes advantage of these 
capabilities to provide a dynamic interface to Java.

2. Documentation
----------------

The best way to get started with Tcl Blend is to look at the demos
provided in this release. The "docs" directory contains additional
information. See the "diffs.txt" file in this directory for a list
of Java Package features and the extent to which they are
implemented in Tcl Blend. Also, look at the Scriptics Jacl and
Tcl Blend page at http://www.scriptics.com/java for other useful
information.

3. Requirements
---------------

Tcl 8.3.2 or greater, the Tcl Thread extension, and the Java
Development Kit 1.1 or greater are required to use Tcl Blend.

To build Tcl Blend on Solaris the Native Threads Pack, and 
several patches, must be installed on top of the JDK.  The 
package, necessary patches, and installation instructions can 
be found at http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/index.html.

Tcl Blend will build and run under JDK1.2 and newer, see
known_issues.txt for a list of problems and bugs.

4. Installation
---------------

A unified build system that works under both Unix and Windows
is used to build Tcl Blend. To build on UNIX, just run the
supplied configure script in a shell. To build on Windows,
you will first need to build the Tcl and Thread packages
using the msys_mingw package. See the Tcl win/README file
for more information about how to install and build Tcl
and the Thread package with msys_mingw.

Tcl 8.3.2 or newer is required when building under UNIX.
Tcl 8.4.2 or newer is required when building under Windows.
In either case, the most recent release of the Thread package
is strongly suggested. Tcl must be built as a shared library
with threads enabled.

To run the configure script, just type ./configure in the
toplevel directory. This runs a configuration script created
by GNU autoconf, which configures Tcl Blend for your system and
creates a Makefile. The configure script allows you to customize
the Tcl Blend configuration for your site; for details on how you can
do this, type "./configure --help" or refer to the autoconf
documentation (not included here). The most commonly used
arguments to the configure script are as follows:

	--prefix=DIR		By default, the configure script will
                                assume that you want to install into
                                /usr/local. Under Windows, the /usr/local
                                directory is mapped to a Windows path
                                based on where you installed mingw_msys.
				One can specify a specific install
                                directory by passing the directory name
                                as an argument to the prefix option.
                                For example, --prefix=/opt/jacl or
                                or --prefix=D:/jacl under Windows.

	--with-tcl=DIR		Pass the absolute unix path name of the
				directory where Tcl has been build
				as the value of DIR.

	--with-thread=DIR	Pass the absolute unix path name of the
				directory where the Tcl thread
				extension has been build as the
				value of DIR.

	--with-jdk=DIR		By default, the configure script will
                                attempt to find the JDK by searching on
                                the PATH for the javac program. If the
                                javac program can not be found on the
                                PATH or if you do not want to use the
				JDK that it finds, you will need to use
                                this switch to tell configure where
                                it should look for the JDK binaries.

	--with-jikes=PROG	The JDK ships with a java compiler called
				javac. This compiler works but it is very
				slow. Many people would rather use the
				jikes compiler from IBM because it is much
				faster than javac and it produces better code.
				On my system, a compile with javac takes
				1 minute while a compile with jikes
                                takes less than 3 seconds. If this switch is
                                given with no PROG argument then the configure
                                script will search for jikes on the PATH.
                                If a PROG argument is provided it must be the
                                absolute path name of your jikes executable.
                                See www.research.ibm.com/jikes for more info.

Running the configure script will generate a Makefile, assuming that
no errors occurred during the configure process. You should now
type "make", this will create two library files called tclblend.jar and
tcljava.jar. The tclblend.jar library file stores the class files that
are only used by Tcl Blend. The tcljava.jar library file stores the class
files that are shared between jacl and tclblend. Make will also create
a Tcl Blend shared library, libtclblend.so under UNIX or tclblend.dll
under Windows.

After the make finishes you can quickly test out Tcl Blend by typing
"make shell" which will drop you into a running Tcl Blend shell where
you can type in commands. Type "package require java" in the shell
to load the Tcl Blend shared library. You can also run the regression
tests by typing "make test". See tests/README for more information
about the regression test suite.

When you are ready to install type "make install" to install
the Tcl Blend libraries on your system. Doing the install will
also create a pair of wrapper scripts called jtclsh and jwish
which you can use to run Tcl Blend without setting lots of
environmental variables by hand. After the wrapper script has
been installed a test program will be run to ensure that
the installed program is working correctly.

See the file "license.terms" for information on usage and 
redistribution of this file, and for a DISCLAIMER OF ALL WARRANTIES.

6. Contact Information
----------------------

Tcl Blend 1.0 was released by the now defunct SunScript group at Sun Labs.
The majority of the Jacl/Tcl Blend developers spun out of Sun Labs
into Scriptics.

Jacl 1.1 and 1.2 were primarily by people outside of Scriptics,
with assistance from Scriptics.

Newer versions of Jacl are crafted by independent developers.

7. Getting Help
----------------

Users of Tcl Blend or Jacl should make use of the tcljava-user mailing
list at SourceForge. This is the place to ask questions or post scripts
that are causing you trouble. Basically, any Jacl or Tcl Blend related
question is fine on the user list.

http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tcljava-user

There is also a mailing list for Jacl and Tcl Blend developers.
If you have a specific question about some implementation feature,
have a patch for Jacl or Tcl Blend, or are interested in implementing
some feature, then you should post a note to the developers mailing list.

http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/tcljava-dev

Note that you will have to subscribe to the mailing lists before
posting to them. Some people this is is somehow "unfriendly", but
if we did not do this the mailing list would be full of spam and
it would be useful to nobody.

In addition to the mailing lists, you can ask about Jacl or Tcl Blend
or on the Tcl newsgroup. The network news group "comp.lang.tcl"
intended for the exchange of information about Tcl, Tk, and
related applications. It can also be useful to do a google groups
search on comp.lang.tcl for Jacl or Tcl Blend related questions.

When reporting bugs, please provide a short Tcl script that we can use
to reproduce the bug.  Make sure that the script runs with bare-bones
Tcl and doesn't depend on any extensions or other programs,
particularly those that exist only at your site.  Also, please include
these additional pieces of information with the script:
    (a) How do we use the script to make the problem happen (e.g.
	what things do we click on, in what order)?
    (b) What happens when you do these things (presumably this is
        undesirable)?
    (c) What did you expect to happen?
    (d) What platform are you running on (Machine, OS, etc.)?
    (e) What releases of Tcl products are you using?
