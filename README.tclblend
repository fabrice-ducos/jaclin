Tcl Blend

RCS: @(#) $Id: README.tclblend,v 1.1.1.1 1998/10/14 21:09:07 cvsadmin Exp $

1. Introduction
---------------

Tcl Blend provides two capabilities to the Tcl system.  First, 
Tcl Blend provides Java classes that expose key pieces of the 
interfaces that are available to extension writers who currently
use C.  Using these classes, extension writers can create new 
commands for the Tcl interpreter.  In addition, Tcl Blend provides 
commands that allow script writers to directly manipulate Java 
objects without having to write any Java code.  The reflection 
classes in JDK 1.1 make it possible to invoke methods and access 
fields on arbitrary objects.  Tcl Blend takes advantage of these 
capabilities to provide a dynamic interface to Java.

2. Documentation
----------------

The best way to get started with Tcl Blend is to look at the demos
provided in this release.
Also, look at the Scriptics Jacl and Tcl Blend page at
http://www.scriptics.com/java
for other useful information.

3. Requirements
---------------

Tcl8.0 and the Java Development Kit 1.1 or greater is required.

For building Tcl Blend on Solaris the Native Threads Pack, and 
several patches, must be installed on top of JDK1.1.  The 
package, necessary patches, and installation instructions can 
be found at http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.1/index.html.

Tcl Blend 1.1 will run under JDK1.2fcs, see known_issues.txt for
a list of bugs.

4. Installation
---------------

Change to the "unix" subdirectory if you're compiling under UNIX,
or "win" if you're compiling under Windows.  Then follow the 
instructions in the README file in that directory for compiling 
Tcl, installing it, and running the test suite.

5. License Agreement
---------------------

See the file "license.terms" for information on usage and 
redistribution of this file, and for a DISCLAIMER OF ALL WARRANTIES.

6. Contact Information
----------------------

Tcl Blend 1.0 was released by the now defunct SunScript group at Sun Labs.
the majority of the Jacl/Tcl Blend developers spun out of Sun Labs
into Scriptics.

Tcl Blend 1.1 was developed primarily by people outside of Scriptics, with
assistance by Scriptics.  Currently, the Tcl Blend tree is
available via the Scriptics CVS repository at
http://www.scriptics.com/software/netcvs.html

7. Tcl newsgroup
----------------

There is a network news group "comp.lang.tcl" intended for the exchange
of information about Tcl, Tk, and related applications.  You should
use this newsgroup to ask questions, give bug reports, or post fixes
for Jacl & Tcl Blend.   The developers of Jacl & Tcl Blend as well as
many avid users of Tcl Blend & Jacl use comp.lang.tcl as a forum.

8. Support and bug fixes
------------------------

Unfortunately, Scriptics, University of Minnesota and UC Berkeley
cannot offer direct technical support for Jacl and Tcl Blend.  We
prefer that you send bug reports and fixes to the comp.lang.tcl
newsgroup rather than to any one individually.  We'll see anything on
comp.lang.tcl, and in addition, someone else who reads comp.lang.tcl
may be able to offer a solution.

When reporting bugs, please provide a short Tcl script that we can use
to reproduce the bug.  Make sure that the script runs with bare-bones
Tcl and doesn't depend on any extensions or other programs,
particularly those that exist only at your site.  Also, please include
five additional pieces of information with the script:
    (a) How do we use the script to make the problem happen (e.g.
	what things do we click on, in what order)?
    (b) What happens when you do these things (presumably this is
        undesirable)?
    (c) What did you expect to happen instead?
    (d) What platform are you running on (Machine, OS, etc.)?
    (e) What releases of Tcl products are you using?
